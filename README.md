## Retrode SMS/Game Gear Adapter label

![label](label.png)

This is a label for a [Retrode SMS plugin](https://www.dragonbox.de/en/accessories/cartridge-dumper/retrode2-sms-plugin-cartridge-dumper)
with the Game Gear cartridge port installed.

Wanting to combine the styles of the SMS and the Game Gear, I went with the
late SMS/early Brazilian Game Gear small checkerboard styles, with white and
gray colours.

Lettering uses [Gelosia](https://github.com/SorkinType/Gelasio/), a Georgia font
drop-in. The label was created using Inkscape.

The Game Gear "Master System" style image comes from [this Sega-16 article](http://www.sega-16.com/2015/11/interview-stefano-arnhold-tectoy/).
